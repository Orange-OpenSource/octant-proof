Section Purge.
(** * Purging a program *)
(** The underlying idea of this section is that if we have computed the semantic
  of our program and found all the values of the [i]th argument of
  atoms with symbol [f], now we can look at the clauses of our program and
  remove all the clauses that contains atom with symbol [f] where the [i]th
  argument is another constant because they do not play a role in our semantics
   *)
Variable p : program.
Variable i : interp.
Variable def : syntax.constant.

(** A symbol *)
Variable f : symtype.
(** The index of an argument of this symbol *)
Variable ind : 'I_(arity f).
(** A set of value *)
Variable vals : {set syntax.constant}.

(** The hypothesis states that [vals] contains all the values of the [ind]eth
   argument of [f] that appear in the computation of the
   semantics of [p] for interpretation [i] *)
Hypothesis vals_adeq : forall (c def : syntax.constant) (m : nat) (ga : gatom),
           ga \in (sem p def m i) -> sym_gatom ga = f
        -> nth_error (arg_gatom ga) ind = Some c
        -> c \in vals.

(** [keep_atom a] filters out the atom [a] that have symbol [f] and whose [ind]eth
  argument is a constant that is not in [vals] *)
Definition keep_atom (a : atom) : bool :=
  (* the atom must obviously be the currently studied predicate *)
  if (sym_atom a == f)
    then match nth_error (arg_atom a) ind with
            (* if the argument position holds a variable, nothing to do *)
          | Some (Var v) => true
            (* if it is a value, the rule is erased iff. it is not captured in vals *)
          | Some (Val c) => c \in vals
            (* this hopefuly won't happen *)
          | None => false end

(** We keep a clause if all its atoms in the body and the head
   are keepable *)
Definition keep_rule (cl : clause) : bool :=
  match cl with Clause hd tl =>
    (keep_atom hd) && all keep_atom tl end.

(** We define pp as the restriction of p purged of non keepable clauses *)
Definition pp := filter keep_rule p.

Lemma pp_p : pp \subset p.
Proof.

(** If there is a substitution [s] such that [s a] is in the semantic of [p] for [i],
   then [a] can be kept. (ie it will not have as [ind] argument something that was
   not captured by [vals] *)
Lemma keep_atom_sem (m : nat) (s : sub) (a : atom) : gr_atom_def def s a \in sem p def m i -> keep_atom a.

(** if [tl] can be extended by [s] to be in the semantics of [p] for [i], then
   we can keep [tl].*)
Lemma keep_atom_tail_match (m : nat) (s : sub) (tl : seq atom) :
  s \in match_body (sem p def m i) tl -> all keep_atom tl.

(** The semantics of the purged program contains the semantics of [p] *)

(** The semantics of the purged program is a subset of the semantics of p *)
Lemma purge_sem_soundness : forall m, sem pp def m i \subset sem p def m i.
